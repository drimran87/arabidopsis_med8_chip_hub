# Arabidopsis TAIR10 Track Hub for Mediator ChIP-seq)
This repository documents how we created a public **UCSC Track Hub** for our Mediator ChIP-seq (anti-Med8) on *Arabidopsis thaliana*: wild-type **Col-0** and **med18** mutants under control conditions.

We use a custom TAIR10 genome with chromosome names **Chr1–Chr5, ChrC, ChrM**. Because those names can differ from UCSC’s stock assemblies, we built our **own hub** so the data render correctly.

Our assembly key in this hub: tair10 (with Chr names)
